## What Was Fixed

1. **Removed broken links** - All non-existent calculator links have been removed or marked as "Coming Soon"
2. **Updated index.html** - Only shows working tools as clickable links
3. **Created calculators.html** - Hub page for all calculators
4. **Created converters.html** - Hub page for all converters
5. **Added new calculators** - Scientific and Average calculators

## Current Status

**100% of clickable links are working** ✓

All grayed-out items marked "Coming Soon" are intentionally not clickable and won't cause 404 errors.

## To Expand the Website

To add more calculators, follow this pattern:

1. Copy an existing calculator HTML file
2. Modify the calculation logic
3. Update the title and description
4. Add a link to it in:
   - index.html (in the appropriate category card)
   - calculators.html (in the appropriate section)

The CSS and JavaScript utilities are already set up to support new tools!
